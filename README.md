# Basic VHDL Utilities

## Exercise 1:
Register with asynchronous reset.

## Exercise 2:
Register of a given size with asynchronous reset.

## Exercise 3:
Counter increasing while enabled and having the MSB of the value as an output.
The objective of the benchmark is to show that the MSB is changing periodically between 0 and 1. 
The benchmark uses a 4-bits counter to accelerate testing times. 
We will want to use a 26-bits counter to have the MSB change every second.

## Exercise 4:
UAL allowing basic operations between two integers. Supporte operations are +, -, *, and, or, not, xor.
The benchmark uses 2 and 3 as inputs and tests every operation.

## Exercise 5:
128-address RAM. Each address is 8-bits wide. 
The benchmark writes in each address every 10 cycles.
